abstract = "It is widely known that, for most natural images, appropriate contrast enhancement can usually lead to improved subjective quality. Despite of its importance to image processing, contrast change has largely been overlooked in the current research of image quality assessment (IQA). To fill this void, in this paper we first report a new and dedicated contrast-changed image database (CID2013). The CID2013 database is composed of four hundred contrast-changed images of fifteen original natural images and the mean opinion scores (MOSs) recorded from twenty-two inexperienced viewers. We then proposed a novel reduced-reference image quality metric for contrast-changed images (RIQMC) using entropies and order statistics of the image histograms. Experimental results on the CID2013, TID2008, and CSIQ databases demonstrate that the proposed RIQMC metric outperforms some mainstream image quality assessment methods."
