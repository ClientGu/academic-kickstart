abstract = "Screen content is typically composed of computer generated text and graphics. The contents shown on the screen exhibit various unnatural properties, such as sharp edges and thin lines with few color variations. In this paper we design a novel structure-induced quality metric (SIQM) for assessing the screen image quality. The proposed SIQM works by weighting the benchmark structural similarity index (SSIM) with the structural degradation measurement that is computed using SSIM as well. Experimental results conducted on the newly released subjective quality database concerning screen images show that on one hand the proposed technique is superior to existing quality measures, and on the other hand our model is able to optimize screen video coding and thus introduce remarkable visual quality improvement."
