abstract = "With the rapid development of visual media, people prefer to pay more attention to privacy protection in public situations. Currently, most existing researches on information security such as cryptography and steganography mainly concern transmission and yet little has been done to keep the information displayed on screens from reaching eyes of the bystanders. At the same time, the reporter just stands in front of the screen during traditional meetings. Limited time, screen area and report forms, which inevitably leads to limited information. As a result, we design a portable screen for assisting the reporter to present any information in a new form. In some public occasions, the reporter can show private content with important information to authorized audience while the others can not see that. In this paper, we propose a new Spatial PsychoVisual Modulation (SPVM) based solution to the privacy problem. This system uses two synchronized projectors with linear polarization filters and polarization glasses, and a camera with linear polarization filter the metallic screen. It can guarantee the system shows private information synchronously. We have implemented the system and experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed information security display system."
