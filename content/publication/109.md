abstract = "Owing to the thriving market of stereoscopic image based applications, efficient and effective 3D image quality assessment (IQA) techniques become colossally required these days. Consequently, we introduce a new reduced-reference (RR) stereoscopic image quality metric to meet this demand, through measuring Structural degradation and Saliency based Parallax compensation Model (SSPM). Experimental results on the LIVE 3D Image Quality Database, including both symmetrically and asymmetrically distorted stereoscopic images in different categories and quality levels, are provided to justify the effectiveness of the proposed SSPM model as compared to some existing progressive and popular stereoscopic IQA approaches. Meanwhile, it deserves broad attentions that only four number pairs, extracted from original image, are required as the key feature to be sent to the receiver terminal, thus making this procedure also efficient."
