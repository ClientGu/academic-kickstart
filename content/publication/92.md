abstract = "Three-dimensional (3D) imaging technology has been growingly prevalent in today's world. But objective quality assessment of 3D images is a challenging task. In this paper, we try to investigate and develop the 2D image quality metrics into stereoscopic image quality assessment using a dual-weight model within the concept of free energy principle and human visual system. On the basis of a psychological measure, the free energy is a principle telling where supervises more and attracts human attention. We believe that the ‚Äúsurprise‚Äù can account for the binocular rivalry and introduce the inter-weight. Also, the intra-weight is computed according to the physiology of human visual system. We first do the intra-weighted 2D image quality assessment. With inter-weights, we then calculate the combining score of stereopairs. Experiments are performed on the symmetric LIVE3D-I and asymmetric LIVE3D-II databases. Results confirm that the proposed 3D IQA technique, appropriately computing and combining the inter- and intra-weights, is able to faithfully predict the visual quality of stereopairs."
