abstract = "The free-energy principle in recent studies of brain theory and neuroscience models the perception and understanding of the outside scene as an active inference process, in which the brain tries to account for the visual scene with an internal generative model. Specifically, with the internal generative model, the brain yields corresponding predictions for its encountered visual scenes. Then, the discrepancy between the visual input and its brain prediction should be closely related to the quality of perceptions. On the other hand, sparse representation has been evidenced to resemble the strategy of the primary visual cortex in the brain for representing natural images. With the strong neurobiological support for sparse representation, in this paper, we approximate the internal generative model with sparse representation and propose an image quality metric accordingly, which is named FSI (free-energy principle and sparse representation-based index for image quality assessment). In FSI, the reference and distorted images are, respectively, predicted by the sparse representation at first. Then, the difference between the entropies of the prediction discrepancies is defined to measure the image quality. Experimental results on four large-scale image databases confirm the effectiveness of the FSI and its superiority over representative image quality assessment methods. The FSI belongs to reduced-reference methods, and it only needs a single number from the reference image for quality estimation."
