abstract = "The ubiquitous screen content images (SCIs) play a significant role in various scenarios currently. However, most SCIs captured by consumer devices are frequently corrupted with distortions, especially contrast distortion. Unlike the natural images, SCIs are composed of text, graphics and natural scene pictures so that traditional image enhancement methods are not suitable for these compound images. Therefore, we innovatively proposed an adaptive strategy for enhancing SCIs in this paper. Firstly, we devised a segmentation method to divide SCI into text and pictorial regions. Next, the famous guided image filter (GIF) with big and small kernel sizes served as unsharpness masking for processing different regions adaptively. For verifying performance, the proposed method was tested on recently prevalent SCI datasets including SIQAD, and Webpage Dataset. Experimental results indicate that the proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in most SCIs with flat background."
