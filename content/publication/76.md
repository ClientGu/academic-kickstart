# Abstract and optional shortened version.
abstract = "With the prevalence of digital products like cellphone, tablet and personal computer, the screen content image (SCI) consisting of text, graphic, and natural scene picture becomes a significant media in various communication scenarios. Consequently, we proposed a reduced-reference quality metric dedicated for SCI. The main contribution includes 2 aspects: 1) we innovatively proposed a layer-based segmentation method to divide SCI into text layer and pictorial layer; 2) we designed respective quality metrics dedicated for text and pictorial layers with a novel pooling strategy considering human visual saliency for SCI. Furthermore, exhaustive experimental results indicate that the proposed metric is highly comparative compared with state-of-the-art full-reference quality metrics."
